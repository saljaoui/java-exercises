# Project Setup and Execution Guide

This guide will help you set up the project structure, copy your exercise files, compile, and run your Java code using Maven. The script also supports multiple environments for code execution

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java** (JDK version 8 or higher)
- **Maven**

### Install Maven

To install Maven, use the following commands based on your operating system:

#### Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install maven
```

Additionally, you should create a student/ folder and place your exercise folder within it. For example:

```bash
student/
└── starMass/
    └── StarMass.java
    └── CelestialObject.java
    └── Galaxy.java
    .....
```
## Run the Script
Execute the script in your terminal using:

```bash
EXERCISE={ExercieName} ./entrypoint.sh
```

*Good luck :)*
